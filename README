Randomness to make my life easier, includes:

games - quickly mount and run windows games
avi2zen - encodes a movie file and transfers to zen
cal2zen - downloads a google calendar and transfers it to the zen
sub-demangler - encodes subtites (and other text files) that have been 
mangled due to incorrect encoding.
